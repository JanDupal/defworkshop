# Defworkshop

These are materials for the Clojure Workshop.

Please fork the repo, and enjoy the show!

Run `lein marg` and open `docs/uberdoc.html` in your browser to view contents.

Implement functions, and have lots of FN!

# Concepts

Tasks are broken down into groups:

### Simple Functions

  * prefix notation
  * anonymous functions
  * function shortcuts
  * function composition (`comp`, `partial`, `complement`)
  * multiple-arity functions
  * language primitives (keywords, symbols
  * simple destructuring patterns
  * concept of let
  * conditionals
  * usage of closures

### Data Structures

  * vectors, lists, sets, maps
  * sequential and associative DSs
  * accessing values
  * adding/removing values to/from list
  * updating

### Working with sequences

  * basic sequence operations (map, reduce, filter, remove)
  * combining sequence operations
  * for/doseq for eager list manipulation and side-effects
  * how to use recursion instead of state

### Destructuring

  * how to use map destructuring
  * how to use list destructuring

### Java Interop

  * how to generate a java class
  * how to create an Jar entrypoint
  * reify, proxy

### Macros

  * macros basics
  * delayed evaluation

### Software Transactional Memory

  * basic STM concepts
  * how to mutate an STM variable

### Concurrency

  * futures
  * launching threads

## Multimethods

  * functional polymorphism
  * application and usage of multimethods

## Protocols

  * functional polymoprhism
  * application and usage of protocols
